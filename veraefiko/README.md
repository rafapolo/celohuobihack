**Celo x Huobi: Stablecoin in Web3 & Sustainability 2022**

In Esperanto, *Vera Efico* means *Real Impact*. 

#### Description

This project proposes a noble usage for the Celo stablecoin pegged to the brazilian official R$ Real currency: an innovative system enabling the 1.3 billion bank accounts in the country to acquire tokens and multi-chain cryptocurrencies at Huobi Exchange directly from their own bank accounts, taking advantage of the new Brazilian Central Bank protocol for instant payment, allowing us to convert a R\$ PIX transfer into 1:1 Celo cR\$ - tradable for 1291 Huobi tokens through our dApp - while collecting an experimental market-maker fee, directly distributed into impactMarket's poverty alleviation mechanisms, and our own MCO2 token vault - used to bootstrap our DAO aiming to acquire a land for collective regeneration.

#### Scenario

- Brazil is the sixth most populated country in the world. Home to roughly 214 million people today, it accounts for almost half of South America’s inhabitants. By 2023 we might have our own CBDCs. 
- Over 60% of Brazil’s population fall under the millennial or Gen Z bracket, with youths aged 15–24 accounting for more than ⅓ of the total population.
- According to an Harvard Business School case-study, “in December 2018 the interest rate in Brazil for corporate loans was 52.3%, for consumer loans it was 120.0% and for credit card indebtedness it was 272.42%". DeFi might change this scenario.
- Of the whole population, around 70% have regular Internet access and own a smartphone. There are more phones than people.
- For now, we have creative friends earning the brazilian minimum wage of \$0.95 per hour (R\$1200/month ~ $230), while official statistics shows that half of Brazilian workers receives even less. 
- In their blind thirst for profit, some big investment firms providing crypto are also linked with Amazon-deforestation ventures. In the last 30 years, rainforests equivalent to Spain's territory size was devastated.
- More than 20 percent of the world oxygen is produced in the Amazon Rainforest, still home of more than 300 original tribes, and with 40% of its territories under non-protective Brazilian policies.

#### Problem(s)

With open eyes, Latin America is full of problems - specially on public governance and the usage of resources - which CELO technology opens new paradigms on decentralized coordination to better deal with. While it is important to see problems holistically, we need to be analytic to propose small iterative steps to pedagogically achieve solutions together. Let's describe a few stories around us, as inspirations for a smaller generalized problem to tackle;

- For years we interact on a Telegram group with 40 thousand brazilians supporting each other on buying cryptocurrency out of centralized exchanges, discussing projects, micro-investing, doing risky p2p and announcing all sort of demands involving the cryptoeconomy.
- Many people get really lost on the Exchanges bureaucracies requirements and with frustrated UX navigation, when they just need a token to join a game, vote on a DAO, invest as some trusted friends suggests, or just to PoolTogether. Most users are digging opportunities on profitable trends.
- Many people don't trust the Fiat<>Crypto centralized Companies regarding the way they might monitor wallets, or don't want to make these few founders richer.
- Cryptocurrencies on some p2p platforms can be up to 20% more expensive than on CEX.
- Lots of confusions with order books, liquidity, and complex miners + withdraw fees arithmetic.
- Most friends-of-friends mediation solutions (as I have done some times) requires some hours-before R$ Real/BRL deposit and a later conversion and transfer with a variable price. The new Brazilian payment protocol changes that.
- Many people just want a non-custodian fast service: Choose -> Pay in R$ -> Validate -> and Receive the cryptocurrency or token in their own private wallet.

For this Hackaton we are experimenting with a 3-pillars system provided to the group above, bridging and re-routing a tiny part of this decentralized financial flows into *real impact* beyond crypto *per se*.

#### Vision

When coinage was first introduced into the Greek world in the 7th century BC, it was not seen as an economic instrument so much as a magical charm, "*a talisman that could at will transform itself into any desirable or desired object.*" Today, 2800 years later, the notion that money is a tool to satisfy the individual's unlimited desires is still dominant.

As we write, the largest national crypto CEX in Brazil, with more than 1.5 million users, had a 24h trading volume of $4,345,824 from small investors. Basic maths shows us that *every day*, their users spend the equivalent to a minimum-wage paid to 300 people *for one year*, or hypothetically, beyond the pure individual speculation, this one-day crypto-flow of small investors could fund 20 people with exorbitant salaries for two year to research and build *real impact* projects. Even a fraction of this crypto-exchanges flows could become collective investments in Open Universities or ReFi Hacklabs.

There is money! But the ways it is operated today makes it extremely concentrated in networks far from the urgent social and natural needs. We are Celo Maximalists, in the sense of believing that there are beautiful ways to understand and spread prosperity, as the new programmable monetary paradigm creates new economic models. We believe it is a question of exemplar collective organization and distributed awareness, potentially enabled by blockchain concepts, removing the barriers for better cooperation among financially-aware self-managed collectives.

Changing time, some technologies can be revolutionary, as when on the 12th century Fibonacci published about the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, bringing light to the works from Persian mathematicians Al-Khwārizmī - "Algorithm" comes from his name - a 9th century mathematicians who translated older Sanskrit texts from the much older Hindu mathematicians Aryabhata, who - on the 5th century - calculated Earth's circumference with an accuracy of 0.3% without clocks or telescopes, just using his own numeric system based on phonetics. For more than one thousand years Europeans used Roman numerals, can you imagine us today in MMXXII doing the same? A non-decimal system for daily arithmetic - the computers we know today wouldn't even exist without this new notion. The Statistics foundations came a few centuries later, so, understanding our chances we could finally have better luck.

The full way around in hypertextual history, some researchers says the english word *cash* came from the Sanskrit unit of measure, Karṣa (कर्ष). In between, it was just in the the 13th century that Marco Polo described in his book of travels the fiat money of the Yuan Dynasty; 

> All these pieces of paper are issued with as much solemnity and authority as if they were of pure gold or silver... and indeed everybody takes them readily, for wheresoever a person may go throughout the Great Kaan's dominions he shall find these pieces of paper current, and shall be able to transact all sales and purchases of goods by means of them just as well as if they were coins of pure gold.

Back them, a paper carrying the same value as gold could be equally hard to explain and believe as some of us today describing algorithms running on computers around the globe, acting as distributed treasures potentially operated by many keys - text files carrying secrets that can unlock - on our case - increasing wealth of carbon-markets tokens, economically designed on principles of ecological Karma. Beyond gold; virtual units with values sealed by divine Mathematicians's laws, crypt'okens tradable for real properties in sacred places. For most of us is hard to fully comprehend how it is possible, when it doesn't sound pure magic. If some trees wood's fiber could become valuable paper-money, distributed programmed algorithms now can store intangible natural values in itself.

Information Technologies, as language tools, allow us to shape not just the future, but doing so by changing the past's narratives and visions still reverberating on us now. We carry encoded values within the always-evolving institutionalized languages, as so, we believe that prosperity can collectively increase our conditions to make poverty and deforestation as obsolete as smallpox! Remembered in history as solved problems. Willing so is the first step into all centuries-ahead conquers, and working on the reinvention of money's narrative and redistribution is a challenging inspiration for better times, unlocking new collective actions to reinvent and perform new modes of distributed care.

#### Tech & Architecture   

Coming from years on web2 tech, finally experiments with new web3 protocols and frameworks was a great challenge. While we missed time to integrate all functions, we've architected a scalable system without servers or databases to manage a hybrid-exchange, with potential to become fully on-chain. 
 
Our prototyped system has tree pillars,

1. ##### The MOΞDAO - smart contracts
- moeda is the portuguese world for coin; um moedão is a big one.
- coordinate the usage of the shared cMCO2 vault
- votes and proposals
- manages balances
- manage orders

2. ##### The dApp - a distributed progressive frontend
  - accessible through IPFS
  - connects users to their Celo wallets 
  - lists orders history and statuses
  - validate & convert R$ to cR\$ through Moedax
  - reads the contract's oracle providing current Huobi metadata 
  - stores a new Order on the contract
  - todo: validate provider's metadata signature to avoid potential price-manipulations
  

3. ##### The Agent - an on/off-chain smart-node proposal
    A software prototyped in Ruby connected to a local Celo Full Node, mainly,
    - detecting and converting cReal incomes
    - bridging Huobi Exchange metadata on IPNS
    - executing on-chain Orders off-chain
    - managing transactions and finances
    - converting Celo bridging fees into cMCO2

          }

  ```

  **In a nutshell,**

  When bootstrapped at first, the Smart Node Agent deploys a contract on the Celo network with an IPNS path string. This path is used by the dApp as a decentralized oracle providing updated information on our preprocessed Huobi market data. This contract also stores on-chain orders. Though it operates by itself, the Agent can call Mento stability mechanism for conversions and transfers, and it also integrates the Huobi API - requesting orders and withdraws.
   
  The Agent should be kept awake, constantly checking new cReal deposits and reading Huobi websockets market ticks for the USDT pairs potentially tradable for Celo Reais on our own mechanism. For each price_change event, the prices+fees are calculated as cR\$ Real and published through IPNS on a distributed metadata.json

  The Interplanetary File System protocol is extended with the proposed IPNS Name System, solving the problem of a distributed file having an distinct address on each update, unable to have a unique URL for the updated file. We encode the ipns:// path on the smart contract, enabling the dApp to read an always-updated version of the metadata.json provided off-chain by the Agent. 

  On the dApp side, where the user is a soul, once a Celo Wallet is plugged, the +1200 Huobi tokens and it's prices encoded on the metadata are listed to be acquired with cR\$. We integrated a cReal provider as an external solution, where some basic KYC is validated and the user proofs the ownership of his/her bank account, following local compliance to also protect the provider. Then, a conversion Real 1:1 cReal happens with a single PIX QrCode paid on any national mobile banking.

  Now, jumping in, let's suppose someone with the connected wallet wants to buy a token with cReal on our decentralized approach. The dApp verifies the user's balance and - calling the contract - posts a new on-chain Order encoding his wish. A cReal transfer with the order_id encoded in the comment having this same Order's price pays the conversion service.

  The Agent owns the contract and the local Celo wallets, when it receives a transfer it checks the encoded data, validates it and orchestrate the few conversions from cReal to the desired token at Huobi. Afterall, it withdraws the token from the Exchange to the user's provided wallet and updates the contract:order statuses, or refunds the user's cReal - if fails for our lack of liquidity, suddenly-higher slippages or was paid too late.

  Every night, half of the collected Celo-Huobi bridging service fees are converted into cMCO2 and sent to MOΞDAO's vault.
