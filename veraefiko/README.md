## VERAΞFIKO

In Esperanto, *Vera Efico* means *Real Impact*. 

#### Description

This project proposes a creative and noble usage for Celo Real, the stablecoin pegged to the brazilian official currency. This system enables a bridge for the 1.3 billion bank accounts in Brazil to acquire 150 distinct tokens at Huobi Exchange directly from their own bank accounts, taking advantage of the new Brazilian Central Bank protocol for instant payment, while generating a small market-maker fee distributed directly in between impactMarket and our own MCO2 token vault - increasing until we can use it to acquire a land to protect and build a ReFi Hacklab Center in Brazil and Portugal - our same-language European country most vulnerable to climate change.

#### Problem(s)

With open eyes, South-America is full of problems - specially on public governance and the usage of resources - which web3 technology opens new distributed possibilities and better paradigms to deal with. While it is important to be holistic, we need to be analytic to propose small iterative steps to pedagogically achieve it together. Let's describe a few stories close to us as inspirations for a smaller generalized problem to tackle;

- We are part of a Telegram group with 40 thousand brazilians supporting each other on buying cryptocurrency out of centralized exchanges, discussing projects, micro-investing, doing risky p2p and announcing all sort of demands involving the cryptoeconomy.
- Many people get really lost on the Exchanges bureaucracies requirements and with frustrated UX navigation, when they just need a token to join a game, vote on a DAO, invest as some trusted friends suggests, or just to PoolTogether.
- Many don't trust the Fiat<>Crypto centralized Companies regarding the way they might monitor wallets, or don't want to make these few founders more rich.
- Some brazilian companies providing crypto-investments, in their profit-first blindness, are also linked to Amazon deforestation projects. 
- Cryptocurrencies on some p2p platforms can be up to 20% more expensive than on CEX.
- Most friends-of-friends mediation solutions (as I have done some times) requires some hours-before R$ Real/BRL deposit and a later conversion and transfer with a variable price.
- Lots of confusions with order books, liquidity, and complex miners + withdraw fees arithmetic.
- Many people just want a non-custodian fast service: Choose -> Pay in R$ -> Validate -> and Receive the cryptocurrency or token in their own private wallet.

For this Hackaton we are experimenting with a system that integrates a dApp as a solution for the group above, while re-routing some fresh decentralized financial flows to bootstrap the real impact the world needs beyond crypto *per se*.

- Brazil is the sixth most populated country in the world. Home to roughly 214 million people today, it accounts for almost half of South America’s inhabitants.
- Over 60% of Brazil’s population fall under the millennial or Gen Z bracket, with youths aged 15–24 accounting for more than ⅓ of the total population.
- According to an Harvard Business School case-study, “in December 2018 the interest rate in Brazil for corporate loans was 52.3%, for consumer loans it was 120.0% and for credit card indebtedness it was 272.42%."
- Of the whole population, around 70% have regular Internet access and own a smartphone.
- For now, we have relatives receiving salaries equivalent to \$2 per month in Venezuela and close friends getting the brazilian minimum wage of \$0.95 per hour (R\$1200/month ~ $230), while official statistics presents that half of Brazilian workers get even less than this minimum. 
Creative people struggling in ways that most english-only speakers can't imagine. 

#### Vision

When Lydian coinage were first introduced into the Greek world in the 7th century BC, it was not seen as an economic instrument so much as a magical charm, "*a talisman that could at will transform itself into any desirable or desired object.*" representing until today, 2800 years later, the darkest side of the money paradox: the satiation of the unlimited individual desires.

As we write, the largest national crypto CEX in Brazil, with more than 1.5 million users, had a 24h trading volume of $4,345,824 from small investors. Basic maths shows us that, just in this Exchange, *every day*, users spend the equivalent to a minimum-wage paid to 300 people *for one year*, or, hypothetically, they could fund with a single day-trade flow 20 people earning US-engineers salaries for two year to build a project agreed upon this same users for a *real impact* collective investment, rather than just pure speculation.

There is money! But the way we operate it today makes it flow on the wrong directions, far from the social and natural urgent needs. We are Celo Maximalists, in the sense of believing that there are beautiful ways to understand and spread prosperity, as the new programmable monetary paradigm creates new economic models. We believe it is a question of exemplar collective organization and the distributed awareness potentially enabled by blockchain and web3 concepts - removing the barriers for the cooperation of self-managed collectives.

Some technologies can be revolutionary, as when on the 12th century the mathematician Fibonacci, after a long travel, published "Liber Abbaci" with his discoveries, citing the work of the 9th century Persian mathematicians Al-Khwārizmī - whose name derived into our algorisms and algorithms - who by himself translated some older Sanskrit texts from Hindu mathematicians like Aryabhata from the 5th century - who calculated Earth's circumference with an error of 0.27% without clocks or telescopes just using his own numeric system. For more than thousand years Europeans used Roman numerals, can you imagine us today in MMXXII doing the same? A impossible system for basic arithmetic! Certainly the computers we know today wouldn't even exist. It was just when Fibonacci re-introduced these Hindu-Arabic "new" ways to understand numbers that we could elaborate and operate other new level of abstractions. Statistics foundations came 5 centuries later, so we could finally avoid risks, better understanding the chances.

The full way around and the english word for *cash* came from a Sanskrit unit of measure, Karṣa (कर्ष), some say. 
In between, it was just in the the 13th century that Marco Polo described in his book of travels the fiat money of the Yuan Dynasty;

> All these pieces of paper are issued with as much solemnity and authority as if they were of pure gold or silver... and indeed everybody takes them readily, for wheresoever a person may go throughout the Great Kaan's dominions he shall find these pieces of paper current, and shall be able to transact all sales and purchases of goods by means of them just as well as if they were coins of pure gold.

Back them, a paper carrying more value than gold could be equally hard to explain than today's explanation about an algorithm running on distributed computers around the globe acting as a virtual treasure's chest with potentially many keys needed to open it - text files carrying secrets that can unlock a wealth derived from valuable carbon markets tokens - cryptoeconomical principles for minting ecological Karma - exchangeable for a real land.

As usually history flows untouched, but language always evolve, how are we going to re-tell the future generations that the first South-American explorers had for centuries mistakenly believed that here was the eastern end of Asia; and that is why we still call these original people Indians - the multimilenar people two oceans away in the globe! At least OpenAI tells that "*in Brazil, 180 languages are still spoken today among 300 original ethnic groups"*, but will brazilians one day implement and use a word for *exploit*? We still don't have it. As people can't count when don't have numbers, is the lack of this concept related with native people suffering brutal exterminations and evictions for gold and land for the last 5 centuries? How can we help these natural land-protectors thrive centuries more in a burning world demanding more gold, energy and meat? 

Information technologies are allowing us to reshape not just the future, but doing it by changing past's vision still reverberating on us. Likewise, will one day poverty and violence become obsolete as smallpox? Believing so is a step into it's realization, and the reinvention of money's narrative is certainly a big hope to allow new collective actions, bringing together programmers and poets to invent and perform new languages of care in name of our Mother-Earth, Pachamama - the sacredest.

As sang by the Rio de Janeiro band, El Efecto,

> Two very different things,
One is the price, the other is the value.
Who doesn't understand the difference
little will know about love.

#### Team

Rafael Polo is a brazilian-portuguese Computer Scientist from Rio de Janeiro with a Master in Information Systems and a Greek heart, experimenting with artificial and natural languages for the last 20 years. After working 3 years as a fullstack web2 software engineer for investigative journalists in Berlin, went by bicycle all over the Balkans until reached Athens, where co-created a ComputerLab and volunteered as a teacher to refugees and on-the-edge communities for 4 years. Pandemics shake it all, when moved in a Van to Lisbon and was graced by a Celo Community Fund to research and develop a hybrid-exchange connecting R$ and cR$.

While I took a solo flight on this Hackaton, I might thank many friends for the chats; my sister Marina, a Phd Researcher on Culture and Ideology (despite my failed insistence on the web3 utopias); Jonathan, the young layer helping me to navigate on nebulous compliancies and setup a Ltda Company in Brazil (despite I never said sorry for paying him with tokens that lost 260% in value); Miguel, for inspire me on UX and think software as a product (despite I still believe that Figma creates more problems than solutions); Pedro Victor, the artist who gave me 5 bitcoins in 2011, which I fully sold for a flight to Berlin; and my lovely venezuelan partner Andreina, for her almost-infinite patience and for keeping me aware of the world's struggles beyond my techno-bubbles. I would love to be able to one day join us all into a team and fund back all the love.
