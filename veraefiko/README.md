## VERAΞFIKO

In Esperanto, *Vera Efico* means *Real Impact*. 

#### Description

This project proposes a creative and noble usage for Celo Real, the stablecoin pegged to the brazilian official currency. The system enables a bridge for the 1.3 billion bank accounts in Brazil to acquire 150 distinct tokens at Huobi Exchange directly from their own bank accounts, taking advantage of the new Brazilian Central Bank protocol for instant payment, while generating a small market-maker fee distributed directly in between impactMarket and our own MCO2 token vault.

#### Context

- Brazil is the sixth most populated country in the world. Home to roughly 214 million people today, it accounts for almost half of South America’s inhabitants.
- Over 60% of Brazil’s population fall under the millennial or Gen Z bracket, with youths aged 15–24 accounting for more than ⅓ of the total population.
- According to an Harvard Business School case-study, “in December 2018 the interest rate in Brazil for corporate loans was 52.3%, for consumer loans it was 120.0% and for credit card indebtedness it was 272.42%."
- Of the whole population, around 70% have regular Internet access and own a smartphone.
- For now, we have relatives receiving salaries equivalent to \$2 per month in Venezuela and creative friends getting the brazilian minimum wage of \$0.95 per hour (R\$1200/month ~ $230), while official statistics presents that half of Brazilian workers receives even less.

#### Problem(s)

With open eyes, South-America is full of problems - specially on public governance and the usage of resources - which CELO technology opens new paradigms on decentralized coordination to deal with. While it is important to be holistic, we need to be analytic to propose small iterative steps to pedagogically achieve it together. Let's describe a few stories around us, as inspirations for a smaller generalized problem to tackle;

- For years we interact on a Telegram group with 40 thousand brazilians supporting each other on buying cryptocurrency out of centralized exchanges, discussing projects, micro-investing, doing risky p2p and announcing all sort of demands involving the cryptoeconomy.
- Many people get really lost on the Exchanges bureaucracies requirements and with frustrated UX navigation, when they just need a token to join a game, vote on a DAO, invest as some trusted friends suggests, or just to PoolTogether. Mostly want to make a profit following the trends, or dig them.
- Many people don't trust the Fiat<>Crypto centralized Companies regarding the way they might monitor wallets, or don't want to make these few founders richer.
- Cryptocurrencies on some p2p platforms can be up to 20% more expensive than on CEX.
- Most friends-of-friends mediation solutions (as I have done some times) requires some hours-before R$ Real/BRL deposit and a later conversion and transfer with a variable price.
- Lots of confusions with order books, liquidity, and complex miners + withdraw fees arithmetic.
- Many people just want a non-custodian fast service: Choose -> Pay in R$ -> Validate -> and Receive the cryptocurrency or token in their own private wallet.

For this Hackaton we are experimenting with a system provided to the group above, re-routing a tiny part of this decentralized financial flows into *real impact* beyond crypto *per se*.

#### Vision

When coinage was first introduced into the Greek world in the 7th century BC, it was not seen as an economic instrument so much as a magical charm, "*a talisman that could at will transform itself into any desirable or desired object.*" Today, 2800 years later, the notion that money is a tool to satisfy the individual's unlimited desires is still dominant.

As we write, the largest national crypto CEX in Brazil, with more than 1.5 million users, had a 24h trading volume of $4,345,824 from small investors. Basic maths shows us that *every day*, their users spend the equivalent to a minimum-wage paid to 300 people *for one year*, or hypothetically, beyond the pure individual speculation, this one-day crypto-flow of small investors could fund 20 people with exorbitant salaries for two year to research and build *real impact* projects. Even a fraction of this crypto-exchanges flows could become collective investments in Open Universities or ReFi Centers.

There is money! But the ways it is operate today makes it extremely concentrated in networks far from the urgent social and natural needs. We are Celo Maximalists, in the sense of believing that there are beautiful ways to understand and spread prosperity, as the new programmable monetary paradigm creates new economic models. We believe it is a question of exemplar collective organization and distributed awareness, potentially enabled by blockchain concepts, removing the barriers for better cooperation among financially-aware self-managed collectives.

Changing time, some technologies can be revolutionary, as when on the 12th century Fibonacci published about the Hindu-Arabic decimal numeral system, bringing the works from Persian mathematicians Al-Khwārizmī  - " "Algorithm" comes from his name - a 9th century mathematicians who translated older Sanskrit texts from the much older Hindu mathematicians Aryabhata, who - on the 5th century - calculated Earth's circumference with an accuracy of 0.27% without clocks or telescopes, just using his own numeric system based on phonetics. For more than one thousand years Europeans used Roman numerals, can you imagine us today in MMXXII doing the same? A impossible system for daily arithmetic - the computers we know today wouldn't even exist without this new notion. The Statistics foundations came 5 centuries later, so we could finally avoid risks and better understanding our chances.

The full way around in hypertextual history, some researchers says the english word *cash* came from the Sanskrit unit of measure, Karṣa (कर्ष). In between, it was just in the the 13th century that Marco Polo described in his book of travels the fiat money of the Yuan Dynasty; 

> All these pieces of paper are issued with as much solemnity and authority as if they were of pure gold or silver... and indeed everybody takes them readily, for wheresoever a person may go throughout the Great Kaan's dominions he shall find these pieces of paper current, and shall be able to transact all sales and purchases of goods by means of them just as well as if they were coins of pure gold.

Back them, a paper carrying the same value as gold could be equally hard to explain as some of us describing algorithms running on computers around the globe, acting as distributed iterative-treasures potentially operated by many keys - text files carrying secrets that can unlock always-increasing wealth of carbon-markets tokens, economically designed on principles of ecological Karma. Abstractions swapped into cREAL and exchangeable for a collective property in a sacred place. It is hard to understand, when not sounding as fiction.

Information Technologies, as language, allow us to reshape not just the future, but doing so by changing the past's narratives and visions still reverberating on us. We can definitely make poverty and violence become as obsolete as smallpox! Believing so is the first step into a centuries-ahead realization, but working on the reinvention of money's narrative and redistribution is certainly a big hope to allow new collective actions, bringing together all the programmers and poets to invent and perform new modes of care.

#### Team

Rafael Polo is a Brazilian-Portuguese Computer Scientist from Rio de Janeiro with a Master in Information Systems and a Greek heart, experimenting with artificial and natural languages for the last 20 years. Worked as a Fullstack Web2 Developer in Berlin for 3 years and co-created a Computer Lab in Athens, where volunteered as a teacher to refugees and on-the-edge communities for other 4 years. In 2021 moved to Lisbon, where was graced by a Celo Community Fund to research and develop a hybrid-exchange connecting Celo Real.

While I took a solo flight on this Hackaton, I might thank lots of friends for the chats; my sister Marina, a Phd Researcher on Culture and Ideology (despite my failed insistence on the web3 utopias); Jonathan, the young layer helping me to navigate on nebulous compliancies and setup a Ltda Company in Brazil (despite I never said sorry for paying him with tokens that lost 260% in value); Miguel, for inspire me on UX and think software as a product (despite I still can't believe on OpenAI creating code); Pedro Victor, the artist who gave me 5 bitcoins in 2011, which I fully sold for a flight to Berlin; and my lovely Venezuelan partner Andreina, for her almost-infinite patience and for keeping me aware of the world's struggles beyond my techno-bubbles. 

I would love one day be able to join us all into a team and fund back all the care.
